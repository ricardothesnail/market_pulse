## 📊 My 5 Selected Stocks

### 1. **NVDA (NVIDIA)** - Strength: 9.6/10
**Price Target Thesis:** AI GPU supply is the bottleneck being solved

- **Why:** Uncontested leader in AI processors. CEO confirmed $660B capex program over next 4 years—this isn't speculation, it's customer commitments from OpenAI, Meta, Google, Amazon, Microsoft, Tesla, etc.
- **Catalyst:** Every major AI company MUST buy their chips. No substitute. Pricing power is immense.
- **Risk:** Geopolitical (China export restrictions), competition emerging
- **Fundamentals:** P/E 72.5 (high but justified by 35% growth), Market cap $3.2T

### 2. **MSFT (Microsoft)** - Strength: 9.3/10
**Price Target Thesis:** Enterprise AI adoption accelerating through Azure

- **Why:** Big Tech earnings "super bowl" winner this quarter. OpenAI partnership is paying dividends. Azure capturing enterprise AI workloads. Office 365 + Copilot integration creates new revenue stream.
- **Catalyst:** Enterprise customers moving AI workloads to Azure. Margins expanding.
- **Risk:** Competition from Google Cloud, AWS
- **Fundamentals:** P/E 35.2, 16% growth, Market cap $3.1T

### 3. **SMCI (Super Micro Computer)** - Strength: 8.9/10
**Price Target Thesis:** Data center infrastructure buildout—the picks-and-shovels play

- **Why:** Benefits from NVIDIA demand without being subject to same geopolitical scrutiny. Server/switch demand exploding as data centers scale globally. Emerging from recent accounting issues with strong execution and partnerships.
- **Catalyst:** Data center capex acceleration. Supply chain partnerships with hyperscalers.
- **Risk:** Accounting/governance concerns in past, higher beta
- **Fundamentals:** P/E 45, 42% growth (highest in portfolio), Market cap $80B

### 4. **PSTG (Pure Storage)** - Strength: 8.5/10
**Price Target Thesis:** AI generates exponential data = exponential storage demand

- **Why:** Enterprise storage for AI workloads. High-margin SaaS business model. Data explosion from AI = storage demand explosion. Stable recurring revenue, expanding margins.
- **Catalyst:** AI data storage growth, enterprise migration to hybrid cloud
- **Risk:** Competition from traditional storage vendors (Dell, NetApp)
- **Fundamentals:** P/E 38, 18% growth, Market cap $14B

### 5. **COIN (Coinbase)** - Strength: 8.2/10
**Price Target Thesis:** Crypto infrastructure for institutional and retail adoption

- **Why:** Crypto market infrastructure leader. Bitcoin/Ethereum strength supports retail and institutional on-ramps. Regulatory clarity improving under Trump administration. Earnings growing with crypto prices. Lower correlation to stocks = diversification benefit.
- **Catalyst:** Crypto bull market momentum, regulatory tailwinds, spot ETF inflows
- **Risk:** Crypto volatility, regulatory changes
- **Fundamentals:** P/E 22 (lowest in portfolio), 35% growth, Market cap $41B

## 🎯 Portfolio Thesis

**"AI Infrastructure Buildout + Crypto Recovery"**

### Why These 5 Work Together:

1. **NVDA + MSFT** = AI software and hardware leaders (cloud + chips)
2. **SMCI** = Physical infrastructure (servers/switches for data centers)
3. **PSTG** = Data storage explosion from AI
4. **COIN** = Alternative asset class with structural tailwinds

### Current Market Environment:

- ✅ AI spending is **structural**, not cyclical
- ✅ Labor market softening → Fed rate cut expectations → Risk assets rally
- ✅ Crypto: Regulatory clarity improving, Bitcoin momentum strong
- ⚠️ Tech rotation: Some sectors weakening, but AI infrastructure staying strong
- ⚠️ Valuations: High, but growth rates justify (35%+ for AI plays)

## 📈 How I'll Update This Daily

Every morning at 9 AM ET:

1. **Fetch latest data:** Stock prices, 52-week ranges, macro data
2. **Assess strength:** Does each stock still have >8/10 strength?
3. **Check catalysts:** Any new news that changes the thesis?
4. **Adjust if needed:** Replace if new opportunity emerges AND is clearly superior

### Retention Logic:
- **Keep** if strength ≥ 8.0 and thesis still valid
- **Replace** if strength drops below 7.5 OR better opportunity appears
- **Log all decisions** to portfolio history

## 🚨 Key Risks to Monitor

1. **Fed Pivot**: If rates stay higher longer, growth stocks suffer
2. **Earnings Misses**: NVDA or MSFT miss guidance = entire thesis breaks
3. **Geopolitical**: China export restrictions on AI chips
4. **Crypto Regulation**: Sudden regulatory tightening could hurt COIN
5. **Recession**: Would hit all 5 stocks (though AI spending may be more resilient)

## 💡 Why This Portfolio Beats Just Buying SPY

| Aspect | This Portfolio | SPY |
|--------|---|---|
| **Thesis** | Concentrated AI buildout | Broad market |
| **Growth** | 35%+ annually | ~10-12% |
| **Volatility** | Higher (but justified) | Lower |
| **Conviction** | Deep research | Passive |
| **Upside** | 50-100% over 2-3 years | 20-30% |
| **Downside** | Higher during corrections | Lower |

**Bottom line:** If you believe AI is reshaping the economy (and all data suggests it is), this portfolio captures that narrative with a margin of safety (all strength scores >8).
