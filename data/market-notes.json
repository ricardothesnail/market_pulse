      "marketOverview": "NVIDIA just jumped 7.87% on strong AI demand signals. This is the structural theme—AI infrastructure investment is real, not speculative. My portfolio thesis is validated: NVDA leads, SMCI and PSTG benefit from downstream capex, MSFT captures enterprise adoption, COIN rides crypto tailwinds. Market is rotated toward quality AI plays. Valuations compress on macro uncertainty, but AI capex spending is non-discretionary.",
